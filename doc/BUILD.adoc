The recommended NDK version is `21.4.7075529` or higher.

In the following, the NDK version is denoted as `$NDK_VERSION`.

== Basic environment setup

This project is an Android project using the OpenXR Mobile SDK provided by Meta.
This section describes how to set up a basic development environment. 

=== Device setup

We need to enable developer mode for the Meta Quest 2 / Pro.
Please follow the instructions from Meta below.

https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/[Device Setup]

=== Android development software setup

We have several options for setting up the Android development environment.
Here we will set up the Android development environment using Android Studio.

To get started, download https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html[Android Studio].
For detailed installation steps, refer to the
https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html?pkg=studio#linux[Install Andrdoid Studio] guide.

==== Install additional packages and tools

After installing Android Studio, you can install the following packages:

* Android SDK Platform, API level 26 (Android 8.0 Oreo).
* Android SDK Build Tools, v28.0.3 or higher.
* Android NDK, version `$NDK_VERSION` (see <<About NDK version>>).
* Android CMake, v3.19 or higher. +
In the following, the CMake version is denoted as `$CMAKE_VERSION`.

These packages are installed through the Android SDK Manager.
To access the manager:

1. Open Android Studio.
2. Look for the "SDK Manager" icon
( image:figure/sdk-manager.png["SDK Manager Icon", 30, 30, title="SDK Manager Icon"] ).
You can typically find it in the following locations.
* The "More Actions" button on the "Welcome to Android Studio" page.
* The three vertical dots icon in the upper right corner of the "Welcome to Android Studio" page.
* The "Tools" button in the menu at the top of the editor page.

To select the detailed version, check the "Show Package Details" checkbox.

==== Check the Android SDK location

You can check the Android SDK location in the Android SDK Manager.
It's usually `$HOME/Android/Sdk`, or similar.
In the following, the SDK location is denoted as `$SDK_DIR`.

==== Check the Android NDK location

The NDK location is `$SDK_DIR/ndk/$NDK_VERSION`.
In the following, the NDK location is denoted as `$NDK_DIR`.

==== Set environment variables

Set the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to the JDK location.
It's typically `(/usr/local|/opt)/android-studio/(jre|jbr)`.

Add the JDK tools directory to your `PATH`, typically `$JAVA_HOME/bin`.

=== Download OpenXR SDK

Download the Oculus OpenXR Mobile SDK (v42.0) from
https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-openxr-mobile-sdk/42.0/[here],
and unzip it to a location of your choice.

== Build gRPC

Clone and build https://github.com/zwin-project/grpc-dev[grpc-dev]
using the v1.49.1 branch.
The following assumes you have cloned it to `$MY_DIR/grpc-dev`.

See the README of https://github.com/zwin-project/grpc-dev[grpc-dev] for build instructions.
Please build for both Android and host OS.

== Build Zen Mirror
